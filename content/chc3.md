### The Cobble Hill Computer Coffee Club

Every couple of weeks, some NYC software folks get together to have a morning
beverage in Cobble Hill Park and talk computers. We don't have a set agenda or
topics or speakers. If you're excited about something, we'd love to talk about
it.

We don't have regular scheduled meetings, either. We pick a day about four to
six weeks after our last coffee where the weather looks tolerable. When we do
meet, we tend to start at 9am.

If you want to get an email the next time we meet [sign up here](https://forms.gle/JysGUfh6efiAa8pz7).
