My experience coming to Rust was deeply pleasant, and hopefully the things on your reading list make your experience just as pleasant.<p>If you are someone who understands the difference between a move- and copy-constructors and have used <code>unique_ptr</code> and <code>shared_ptr</code> in anger, you're starting your Rust journey ahead of everyone else. However, you still have things to (un)learn. The compiler will tell you that patterns from your past life are wrong and you're going to have to live with it. Find new ways to do things, instead of brute-forcing your way through with <code>unsafe</code>.<hr><ul><li><p><a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/%22><strong>The Rust Programming Language</strong></a> - The Book. This is a great place to start, even if you're a C++ veteran. It does an excellent job covering the breadth of the language and introduces you to <code>cargo</code> and the <a href=https://crates.io>crates.io</a> ecosystem.</p><li><p><a href=https://rust-unofficial.github.io/too-many-lists/><strong>Learn Rust With Entirely Too Many Linked Lists</strong></a> - A tour through everyone's favorite data structure, by one of the authors of Rust's standard library collections. Starts off basic and veers into advanced territory quite quickly. It's worth reading while you're new to the language, and worth coming back to as you get more comfortable.</p><li><p><a href=https://cliffle.com/blog/rust-typestate/><strong>The Typestate Pattern in Rust</strong></a> - A very high-quality, straightforward demonstration of how to use the type system to help you design an API.</p><li><p><a href=https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling><strong>Rust Error Handling</strong></a> - A long read on error handling from Andrew Gallant, the author of <code>ripgrep</code> and the <code>regex</code> crate. This post walks through idiomatic error handling and motivates the <code>?</code> operator. Error API design is one of the most subtle, difficult parts of Rust to get right. Andrew's blog in general is excellent (I like his <a href=https://blog.burntsushi.net/bstr/>bstr</a> and <a href=https://blog.burntsushi.net/csv/>csv</a> posts too).</p><li><p><a href=https://mmapped.blog/posts/12-rust-error-handling.html><strong>Designing error types in Rust</strong></a> - This post builds on Andrew Gallant's post on errors with a focus on what you want to represent in an error API. This post is also where you'll really start noticing that Rust is secretly an ML-style language. Lean into the functional programming, and follow the links to <a href=https://lexi-lambda.github.io/blog/2019/11/05/parse-don-t-validate/><strong>Parse, Don't Validate</strong></a>.</p></ul><hr><p>Async Rust is a lot. It can feel like it's own sub-language and a completely separate ecosystem. There's a lot to learn here. If you can, try to have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of Rust and the posts above before diving into async.<ul><li><p><a href=https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/%22><strong>Asynchronous Programming in Rust</strong></a> - The async version of The Book. This is still incomplete, but a good place to start. You'll get a basic tour of what Rust Futures are and learn what the hell is going on with <code>await</code> and <code>Pin</code>. After reading this book, <a href=https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html>read the module documentation for <code>std::pin</code></a>. You will return to it many, many times.</p><li><p><a href=https://cliffle.com/blog/async-inversion/><strong>How to think about async/await in Rust</strong></a> - A higher-level explanation of what async is and what it allows you to do at a high level. Since most of the async documentation is how-to, this is a nice change of pace.</p></ul></main><footer></footer></div>
