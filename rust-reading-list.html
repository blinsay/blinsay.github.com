        Rust has a reputation as a hard programming language to learn, despite <a
          href="https://opensource.googleblog.com/2023/06/rust-fact-vs-fiction-5-insights-from-googles-rust-journey-2022.html">evidence
          to the contrary</a>. My experience coming to Rust was deeply pleasant, and
        hopefully this reading list makes your experience just as pleasant.

        If you are someone who understands the difference between a move- and copy-constructors
        and have used
        <pre>unique_ptr</pre> and
        <pre>shared_ptr</pre> in anger, you're starting
        your Rust journey ahead of everyone else. However, you still have things to (un)learn. The compiler will tell
        you that patterns from your past life are wrong and you're going to have to live with it. Find new ways to do
        things, instead of brute-forcing your way through with
        <pre>unsafe</pre>.

        <a href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/book/">The Rust Programming Language</a> - The Book. This is a great place to
        start, even if you're a C++ veteran. It does an excellent job covering the breadth of the language and
        introduces you to
        <pre>cargo</pre> and the <a href="https://crates.io">crates.io</a> ecosystem.

        A tour through everyone's favorite data structure, by one of the authors of Rust's standard library
        collections. Starts off basic and veers into advanced territory quite quickly. It's worth reading while
        you're new to the language, and worth coming back to as you get more comfortable.

        <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/rust-error-handling/">Rust Error Handling</a> -
        A long read on error handling from Andrew Gallant, the author of
        <pre>ripgrep</pre> and the
        <pre>regex</pre> crate. This post walks through idiomatic error handling and motivates
        the
        <pre>?</pre> operator. Error API design is one of the
        most subtle, difficult parts of Rust to get right. Andrew's blog in general is excellent (I like his
        <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/bstr/">bstr</a> and <a href="https://blog.burntsushi.net/csv/">csv</a>
        posts).

        This post builds on Andrew Gallant's post on errors
        with a focus on what you want to represent in an error API. This post is also where you'll really
        start noticing that Rust is secretly an ML-style language. Lean into the functional programming, and

        <h3>Async Rust</h3><br>

      <div class="col-md white ib text">
        Async Rust is a lot. It can feel like it's own sub-language and a completely separate ecosystem. There's
        a lot to learn here. Try to have a solid grasp on the fundamentals of sync Rust before diving into
        async.

        <a href="https://rust-lang.github.io/async-book/">Asynchronous Programming in Rust</a> -
        The async version of The Book. This is still incomplete, but a good place to start. You'll
        get a basic tour of what Rust Futures are and learn what the hell is going on with
        <pre>.await</pre> and
        <pre>Pin</pre>. After reading this book, read the module documentation for <a
          href="https://doc.rust-lang.org/std/pin/index.html">pin</a>. You will return to it many, many times.

        A higher-level explanation of what async is and what it allows you to do at a high level. Since
        most of the async documentation is how-to, this is a nice refresher.
