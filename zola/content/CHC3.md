title = "CHC3 - The Cobble Hill Computer Coffee Club"
+++

Every couple of weeks, some NYC software folks get together to have a morning
beverage in Cobble Hill Park and talk computers. We don't have a set agenda or
topics or speakers - we just chat. If you're excited about something, we'd love
to talk about it.

We don't have regular scheduled meetings - we pick a day about four to six weeks
after our last coffee where the weather looks tolerable. When we do meet, we
tend to start at 9am.

If you want to get an email the next time we meet [sign up here](https://
