title = "CHC3"

Every couple of weeks, the computerati of Middle Brooklyn get together to have
coffee in Cobble Hill Park and talk about what is best in life (and worst in
computers). We call it Cobble Hill Computer Coffee Club, or CHC3 for short.

We always meet at one of the round picnic tables in the park, but don't have
a regular schedule - we pick a day (usually a Friday) based on the weather and
how long it's been since we've last met. If you want to get an email about the
next time we meet [sign up here](https://forms.gle/JysGUfh6efiAa8pz7).
